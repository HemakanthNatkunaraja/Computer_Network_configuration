# University IT Centre and Department Network Design

## Project Overview

This project involves designing a computer network for the newly built IT Centre and Department building at the University. The buildings will house various facilities including discussion rooms, department offices, lecture halls, laboratories, meeting rooms, and computer labs. The goal is to optimize the use of network IP addresses within the available range of `10.20.0.0/16`.

## Building Specifications

### Dimensions (2-Story Building)
- **Length:** 70 meters
- **Width:** 30 meters
- **Height (each floor):** 4 meters

## Network Design Requirements

You are requested to submit a report with the following details:
- Network diagram (subnets and VLANs â€“ provide IP addresses for each of them)
- Steps on how to configure routers and switches
- WiFi access points configuration details

## Importance of Cisco Packet Tracer

Cisco Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulation tool that allows users to design, configure, and troubleshoot networks in a virtual environment. It is widely used in educational settings to help students understand networking concepts and practice their skills without the need for physical hardware. 

### Benefits of Using Cisco Packet Tracer:
- **Hands-On Experience:** Provides a practical way to apply theoretical knowledge in a simulated environment.
- **Visualization:** Helps visualize network topologies and configurations, making it easier to understand complex concepts.
- **Troubleshooting Skills:** Enhances problem-solving skills by allowing users to simulate network issues and resolve them.
- **Collaboration:** Facilitates collaborative learning by enabling multiple users to work on the same project.

## Skills Improved Through This Project
By completing this project using Cisco Packet Tracer, participants will improve the following skills:
- **Network Design:** Ability to design efficient and scalable network architectures.
- **Configuration Skills:** Proficiency in configuring routers, switches, and other network devices.
- **Subnetting:** Understanding of IP addressing and subnetting techniques.
- **Troubleshooting:** Enhanced troubleshooting skills for diagnosing and resolving network issues.
- **Documentation:** Skills in documenting network designs and configurations effectively.
