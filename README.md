# University IT Centre and Department Network Design

## Project Overview

This project involves designing a computer network for the newly built IT Centre and Department building at the University. The buildings will house various facilities including discussion rooms, department offices, lecture halls, laboratories, meeting rooms, and computer labs. The goal is to optimize the use of network IP addresses within the available range of `10.20.0.0/16`.

## Building Specifications

### Dimensions (2-Story Building)
- **Length:** 70 meters
- **Width:** 30 meters
- **Height (each floor):** 4 meters

## Network Design Requirements

You are requested to submit a report with the following details:
- Network diagram (subnets and VLANs â€“ provide IP addresses for each of them)
- Steps on how to configure routers and switches
- WiFi access points configuration details
